In this speech we’ll provide the full pipeline of the work in building the GIS platform of a Roman Villa, Poggio Gramignano at Lugnano in Teverina (Terni). We’ll analize the whole process with a focus over the single moment to analize the GIS for providing data to the 3D reconstructions using pyArchInit to find out more information, and pass all to Blender. The method required a strickly scheduling of the meetings to stay in time for the final work, and we had to undestand how to focusing over single part of the pipeline. pyArchInit platform helped us to decides point of views from the ground or from drones, querying the single phase to decide which was proper to reconstruction or not, realize ipotesis of the entire villa for a comparison with other cases, etc. etc..
